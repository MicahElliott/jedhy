* Jedhy

Inspired by python's ~jedi~ static code analysis tool, ~jedhy~ provides basic
support for autocompletion and documentation introspection for ~Hy~.

It is used in Emacs [[https://github.com/hylang/hy-mode][hy-mode]] IDE which I maintain.
Currently a scaled back version of jedhy is used - automated installation from
pypy still needs to be implemented.
